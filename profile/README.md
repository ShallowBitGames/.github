## Hi! We are ShallowBit 👋

We are a group of hobby developers from a mix of different backgrounds and skillsets.
We met in July 2024 and got started with the 15th Pirate Software Game Jam. 

🧙 We use the Godot Engine, write our own scripts and make our own assets. 🧙

At the moment we are experimenting and learning a lot. Watch this space for some 
interesting ideas that are developing.👀

<!--



**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
